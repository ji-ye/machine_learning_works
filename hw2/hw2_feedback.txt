read data:
5/5

explore:
10/10

preprocess:
- you cannot fill all missing values by mean. For categorical/ discrete variables you should do something else
3/6

generating features:
- you can consider the number of dependents or any discrete variable as categorical, also after discretizing a continuous variable it can be considered as categorical
6/6

classifier:
3/3

evaluation:
3/3

style:
- you can group your functions into separate files depending on their purpose. Then you can organize your code into a few steps. For instance you can have a main function in your code which only calls the following functions:
read_data(input_file)
explore_data( possible columns, options)
pre_process(columns, tasks)
make_features(columns, tasks)
fit_classifier(…)
evaluate(….)
