Problem 1

lol@"Stay out of West Town"
Though, more sanitiation requests does not necessarily mean its a dirtier/cleaner
area. Could be that a neighborhood has low tolerance for crap or something.
You should make better use of plots. The summary statistics/tables are okay, but
having plots as well would be more helpful for understanding the dataset.

Problem 2
The exposition here(both in the writeup and the code) is very underwhelming.
Surely there are more interesting things to comment on based on these added
variables right?
c) -3 no attempt at time series analysis of 311 requests

Problem 3
-5 for no code showing how you got these numbers
10/15

Style:
-1 for the mess in problem1.py
Might as well have this python file instead be an ipython notebook since it looks like
thats the way you've been using it.

Total: 51/60
